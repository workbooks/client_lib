# VBA language binding for the Workbooks API

The WorkbooksApi.cls and Example files are included within the Excel spreadsheet WorkbooksApiExamples.xlsm

## Usage

See the Example files. In the first instance, download the Excel spreadsheet and run it, ensuring that you Enable Macros.
You will need to create an API Key in Workbooks and put that in the cell A1 of the spreadsheet.

## Requirements

This binding has been tested on Windows 10 with Excel 2010 and Excel 2016 (32-bit). It is expected to work on all recent versions of Excel and Windows.

### Known Issues
This binding was tested on macOS 10.12 with Excel 15.32 and was found to be unreliable after a small number of web requests.

## Further Information

The API is documented at <a href="http://www.workbooks.com/api" target="_blank">http://www.workbooks.com/api</a>.

Note that this software does not change often, because it does not need to.  The Workbooks API is designed so that it is based on metadata and although features are added to Workbooks with every release the API does not change.  As far as possible API changes are backwards compatible.  We are proud that software written to our original 1.0 API back in 2009 continues to be both supported and supportable.

To find out more about the many records and fields within your Workbooks database navigate within Workbooks to Configuration > Automation > API Reference.
